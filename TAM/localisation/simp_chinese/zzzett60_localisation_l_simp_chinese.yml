 air_air_missile_1_module_desc:0 "Advances in guided munition technologies have applications for bomber interception. Adding controllable fins to a rocket and a control wire allows a pilot to manually control the flight path of the rocket, allowing far more accurate fire. Since the pilot must use a joystick to control the rocket, the system isn't very effective against enemy fighters, as the pilot would struggle to do two things at once."
 anti_ship_missile_1_module_desc:0 "The earliest forms of guided munitions came in the form of radio control, using a radio transmitter for control and colored lights affixed to the tail of the device to give orientation, a well trained bombardier could guide the munition to the intended target with decent precision while maintaining a decent amount of stand-off range for the aviator. These early munitions were very susceptible to radio jamming."
 anti_ship_missile_2_module_desc:0 "Since rocket technology has become reliable enough to be used in a tactical manner, it seems only logical that adding a rocket motor to our guided munitions would be the next step, allowing further range and higher munition speed. This in turn means that the bombardier is able to better direct the munition, thus allowing for better accuracy."

 night_vision3_desc:0 "Research into Night Vision Devices (NVDs) began in 1929, and the NVD equipment that was used during WWII is now considered Generation 0. Two platoons of Panthers were equipped with the Sperber FG 1250, and the StG-44 with the Vampir ZG 1229. The Soviet Union conducted field tests of the PAU-2 in 1942. The US Army tested the M-1 and M-3 infrared night sighting devices, and in the Korean War this equipment saw limited service assisting snipers."
 infantry_at3_desc:0 "Post war time development of infantry anti-tank weapons focused on two goals. The first is that anti-tank weapons must be able to defeat post war heavy tanks, and second they must be lightweight and portable for infantry."
 infantry_at4_desc:0 "In 1955 the first wire-guided missile, Nord Aviation SS.10, entered service in the French Army. It’s development was inspired by the war time German Ruhrstahl X-4 missile."
 support_weapons5_desc:0 "Post war time development of support weapons focused on improving these weapons. Improvements to the M1919 Browning machine gun included a new cartridge and disintegrating belt links. The weapon was lighter, but still too heavy for combat and thus it was not adopted."
 support_weapons6_desc:0 "Efforts to improve machine guns continued, and in the West a standard Nato grade cartridge was adopted. The Mk 21 was a US Navy conversion of the M1919A4 that fired the 7.62mm Nato cartridge. The M2HB Browning was required to perforate 22.2mm of armour at 91m with armour-piercing ammunition. Both the German MG 42 and Soviet DShK were modernized. The MG 42 would be redesigned as the MG3. Medium machine guns are now classified as GPMG (general-purpose machine guns)."

 tech_recons6_desc:0 "Information gathered by field recce can be by area, route, or zone. Area is a specified location, route may be a road, railway, waterway, or narrow axis of advance, and zone is detailed information about the enemy’s location, strengths, and weaknesses."

 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "The basic structure of a mobile medical unit was established by Major Marran in Patton’s Third Army during WWII. His method of providing medical aid sooner to wounded soldiers was admirade and supported by the command structure. However, it was not until the Korean War that this method of triage was officially adopted by the US military."
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "During the Korean War the US military established mobile army surgical hospitals for providing medical care to wounded soldiers. MASH units were an improvement over the random individual systems of portable surgical hospitals that were used during WWII. Wounded soldiers are first treated on the line and then sent to a battalion aid station to be stabilized. From there they go to a MASH unit for extensive treatment."

Even during the war the Sturmgewehr (StG) 44 greatly increased the volume of fire when compared to the standard infantry rifle. After the war the StG 45, a wartime Mauser prototype, had a significant influence on post war weapon designs. The main focus was to design an assault rifle which was to be gas-operated, selective fire, and have a 20-round magazine."

The Italians designed the LF-59, the Japanese designed the Type 64, and the Germans designed the HK33. The USA, Britain, and the Soviet Union’s weapons development were continuous from wartime to peacetime. The US M-14 rifle comes from improvements made to the M1 Garand. The development of M-16 continues with this process and standardization follows for the Nato countries; ie, 7.62 and 5.56 Nato cartridges. The countries behind the Iron Curtain look to the AK-47, and its variants, as their main battle rifles."

It is gas-operated with a rotating bolt and has an effective firing range of 460m or 500yd. With optics the effective firing range is extended out to 800m or 875yd. Development of the M14 came as a result of improvements being made to the M1 Garand rifle. Improvements to the M1 were being done at the end of WWII, and they included fully automatic firing capability and a 20 round magazine. The M-14 rifle entered production in 1959 and when it entered service it replaced seven other weapons."

Its combat weight was 51,000lbs, and it had the capacity to carry 24 soldiers, one driver, a bow gunner, and a vehicle commander. The vehicle was tested at Fort Knox and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

However, with war raging on the Korean peninsula the Potsdam Order was amended allowing Japan to manufacture weapons for the Japanese military. Howa Machinery (renamed after WWII from Toyoda’s Loom Works) began developing equipment for the Japanese military. The Howa R-1 and R-2 prototypes rifles were based on the US ArmaLite AR-10 (the predecessor to the AR-15). The R-3 prototype followed soon afterwards, but was not officially adopted by the military."

Several prototypes prior to the Type 64 had been tested, but it was the Howa R63E that was used as the basis for developing the Type 64. The rifle entered service in 1964 and it is still in use."
